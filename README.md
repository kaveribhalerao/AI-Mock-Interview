# AI-Mock-Interview
This project is designed to simulate a mock interview experience using Artificial Intelligence. The AI model interacts with the user, asking typical interview questions, assessing responses, and providing feedback. This can be used by job seekers to practice and improve their interview skills.

Features
AI-Powered Interview Simulation: The system asks a variety of common job interview questions across multiple domains.
Real-Time Feedback: After each response, the AI provides feedback on the quality of the answer, including tips for improvement.
Customizable Question Sets: Users can choose the domain or industry for which they want to simulate the interview (e.g., Software Engineering, Marketing, Data Science).
Speech-to-Text Integration: Allows users to speak their responses, with the AI transcribing and analyzing them.
Confidence Assessment: Provides a confidence score based on the structure, tone, and content of the responses.
Question Difficulty Adjustment: The AI adjusts the difficulty of questions based on the user's progress
